Me: I started working on the WeatherWise Python project my professor assigned.
         The code I have isn’t clean, and I get a lot of errors. Can you help me
         make it clean, align with professor stubs, and fix errors?

AI: Certainly. Let's start by reviewing the core parts where you experienced
           issues and go step-by-step.

Me: I got an error when calling generate_weather_response:
         AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'.

AI: That error usually means you passed a string where a dictionary was expected.
           For generate_weather_response, you need to pass:
             1) the parsed question dictionary (from parse_weather_question), and
             2) the actual weather data dictionary.
           Correct call example:
               info = parse_weather_question(user_question)
               data = get_weather_data(info.get('location'))
               print(generate_weather_response(info, data))
           This keeps parsed_question as a dict and resolves the error.

Me: The run_app() menu is also messy — the input reading and conditional blocks
         misalign. Can you fix it?

AI: Yes. The input for the visualisation choice and the if/elif ladder must be
           indented inside the visualise branch. Corrected snippet:
               elif c == '3':
                   p = input('City to visualise: ').strip()
                   res = get_weather_data(p)
                   if not res or 'error' in res:
                       print(f"⚠️ {res.get('error','No data')}")
                       continue
                   print('1) Temperature  2) Rain  3) Both')
                   v = input('> ').strip().lower()
                   if v in ('1','temp','temperature'):
                       create_temperature_visualisation(res)
                   elif v in ('2','lollipop','rain'):
                       matplotlib_lollipop_rain(res)
                   elif v in ('3','both','all'):
                       create_temperature_visualisation(res)
                       matplotlib_lollipop_rain(res)
                   else:
                       print('Choose 1, 2, or 3.')

Me: Can you provide some comments to functions like get_weather_data so it’s easier for me
         to understand?

AI: Certainly. Example outline:
               def get_weather_data(loc, forecast_days=5):
                   """Given a city or PIN/ZIP, fetch weather from Open-Meteo.
                   Returns: city name, current temp, and a 5-day forecast with
                   min/max temps and rain chance."""
                   # 1) Clean the input text
                   # 2) Geocode to lat/lon
                   # 3) Request forecast (current + daily)
                   # 4) Build the small dict shape required by the assignment
                   # 5) Handle network/format errors by returning {}

Me: Finally, I want to make sure the menu calls the right functions for visualizations.
         Here’s my planned code, can you confirm it?

AI: It looks good. Ensure generate_weather_response gets (parsed_dict, data_dict)
           as shown earlier, and the visualisation menu calls the correct functions.
           Keep the menu robust to wrong inputs, and show friendly messages.
