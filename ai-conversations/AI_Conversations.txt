Me: This is an upcoming assignment in python for me before going just explain to me what the assignment is about. I am a beginner, explain to me in simple terms and tell me how to start on this project.

AI: (Explains that the project is about creating a weather app in Python that can: 
- fetch weather data 
- show forecasts in text 
- make visualisations 
- answer natural language questions 
- and use menus for interaction. 
Suggested starting with data retrieval first.)

Me: ⚠️ Could not get weather data. Keys in data: dict_keys([])

AI: That error means the fetch-my-weather package is not returning proper JSON, it’s just giving back strings. Let's switch to Open-Meteo API because it’s free, global, and simple to use.

Me: Could not fetch weather: get_weather() got an unexpected keyword argument 'forecast_days'.

AI: Yes, fetch-my-weather doesn’t support that. Open-Meteo allows geocoding (city → latitude/longitude), current weather, and daily forecast. Let's build a function around that instead.

Me: Before running this should I install something?

AI: Yes, in Colab run:
!pip install matplotlib pyinputplus
This gives you graphing and menu options.

Me: Where should I put the code in step 2?

AI: Under the “Natural Language Processing” section. Replace the `pass` functions with the new ones.

Me: ⚠️ Could not fetch weather: 'str' object has no attribute 'current_condition'

AI: That’s because fetch-my-weather failed. Let’s write a new `get_weather_data()` function with Open-Meteo:
1. Search the city or PIN code with geocoding API.
2. Get weather forecast for that location.
3. Return current temp + 5-day forecast neatly in a dictionary.

Me: Can this be simplified?

AI: Yes. Use a list comprehension for the forecast. Now it fetches the city, current temperature, and 5 days in a clean dictionary.

Me: I want to see the visuals.

AI: Run:
create_temperature_visualisation(weather)
create_precipitation_visualisation(weather)

This shows a line chart (min/max temp) and a bar chart (rain chance).
