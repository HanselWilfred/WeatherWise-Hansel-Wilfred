# ✨ Project Reflection

## 🌟 AI Tools Used

**Gemini:** Gemini, built right into Google Colab, was my coding companion for catching those sneaky indentation errors and helping me polish my comments.  
**ChatGPT:** My go-to assistant! From decoding the assignment to tuning up my WeatherWise app, ChatGPT was always there. It broke down tricky functions, squashed bugs (like NameError in main_menu and matplotlib vlines TypeError), and helped make my code short, clean, and super readable. The console UI and overall code quality in VS Code got a major upgrade thanks to AI.

## 🧠 Prompting Techniques

- **Be specific:** Asked for beginner-friendly, neat code with all my dream features for WeatherWise.
- **Step by step:** Started with pseudocode, then built up to compact code, then added tests.
- **Constrain the output:** Provided exact function names and output formats to keep things on track.
- **Error-driven prompts:** Shared stack traces for targeted, fast fixes.
- **Iteration:** Kept requesting simpler, more elegant versions until it felt just right.

## 🎉 What Worked Well?

Honestly, the WeatherWise app feels like a little celebration of coding! It covers all the essentials—5-day forecasts, smart NLP answers, and cool visualizations. I had a blast experimenting with different chart styles, and adding emojis to the dates gave everything a playful, welcoming vibe. Making the output friendly and intuitive was so rewarding. AI tools made the journey smoother and more creative: they didn’t just help me debug and refine, but also sparked new ideas for presenting the data in fun, memorable ways. The end result is a polished app that feels lively and easy to use.

## 💡 What Would You Do Differently?

If I had a bit more time, I’d switch fully to Visual Studio Code—Google Colab got me started, but I worried about syncing my changes back to VS Code. I was excited to try GUI-based visualizations, but Colab had its limits. Luckily, my VS Code version has these features working in full color and style!

## 🌈 Final Thoughts

Working with AI felt like collaborating with an encouraging, wise friend. It explained the assignment, helped me spot mistakes, and guided me through learning and experimenting. But it still left room for my own creativity and growth. I don’t want this project to just be “an assignment”—I’m eager to take it further in Visual Studio Code, maybe even build it into a mobile app, powered by AI tools. This experience has opened new doors for my future, and I’m grateful for the assignment and my professor’s guidance (especially their push for VS Code!). Thank you for the support and inspiration!
