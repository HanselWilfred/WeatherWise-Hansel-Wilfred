# ✍️ Project Reflection
#AI Tools Used:

Gemini- I used Gemini which was in built in google collabs it helped me with error that would show me in the code mostly with the indentation and commenting stuffs.
ChatGPT- I used chatgpt the most from asking it to explain the assignment to refining my WeatherWise app. It helped me to simplify get_weather_data() while keeping the required output shape, helped me with choosing which resource to download, adding small UX touches (date formatting, temperature emojis, clearer rain notes),
fixing bugs (e.g., NameError from main_menu, matplotlib vlines TypeError),create a clean console UI and short, readable code for VS Code, it helped me with producing clean and concise coding.

#Prompting Techniques:

Be specific: I asked for beginner-friendly clean code with the features i wanted to implement in my weather app.
Step by step: I requested pseudocode first, then compact code, then tests.
Constrain the output: I gave exact function signatures and return formats.
Error-driven prompts: I pasted stack traces to get targeted fixes.
Iteration: I kept asking for smaller/simpler versions until I was satisfied with the output.

#What Worked Well?
I’m proud of how simple the final solution is. The app still does everything (5-day forecast, NLP answers, emojis, charts), also the code is shorter and much cleaner. The tiny helpers—fmt_date, emoji_for_temp, and a clear rain threshold—made the UI feel polished without adding complexity. Open-Meteo API website was a game changer because other APIs were not working for me and it  had issues.

#What Would You Do Differently?
With more time, I’d move to visual studio code, i had already started in google collabs and started working on it and made commit changes in my GitHub repo, so i was worried to return back to vsc even though i asked my professor about it. I felt google collabs had issues, made things more complicated, working only on online and has running issues.I found VSC to be easier, more reliable and future efficient.

#Final Thoughts
Using AI felt like working with a knowledgeable peer, it explained to me the assignment first, what was expected and what needs to be done, it helped me spot mistakes faster, but I still had to read, decide, test, and debug. The biggest lesson was how much clarity in prompts improves both the code and the learning experience.
