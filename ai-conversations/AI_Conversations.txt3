Refining the old code and adding new stuffs using AI
Date: 01/10/2025
Tool: ChatGPT 

Me:
I have an older weather app that fetches data from Open-Meteo. I want to keep it simple but improve how it answers questions and shows forecasts. Can you help me refine it?

AI:
Sure. Let’s keep your structure but clean it up: small helpers, friendly errors, simple NLP (rain vs temperature vs general), date formatting, and emojis for temperature. We’ll also add a “Both” option for charts.

Me:
Start with making the code shorter. It should still do 5-day forecast, show emojis, and only mention rain when it matters.

AI:
I simplified get_weather_data(place):
- Cleans the place text (removes “today/tomorrow/in N days”).
- Returns location, current_temp, and a 5-day forecast.
- Adds an emoji per day (🔥 ≥35, 🙂 15–34, 🥶 <15).
- Only adds “(rain XX%)” when ≥30%.
- Returns {"error":"..."} for no internet or unknown city.

Me:
Make dates human-friendly, like “05 Oct 2025”.

AI:
Added a tiny helper:
- fmt_date(d) = datetime.strptime(d, "%Y-%m-%d").strftime("%d %b %Y")
- Used it in printed lines, charts, and NLP answers.

4) Student:
I want answers to change based on the question. If I ask “Will it rain tomorrow?”, answer only about rain. If I ask “How is the weather today?”, say hot/cool/cold with the degree, and only add rain if it’s notable.

AI:
In the NLP:
- parse_weather_question() extracts location, day (today/tomorrow/in N days), and attribute (“rain” / “temperature” / “general”).
- generate_weather_response() uses that:
  • Rain questions → “Yes likely / Possible / Unlikely — rain XX%.”
  • Temperature/general → “hot and sunny / cool and pleasant / cold” + “(around N°C)”. Add “, rain XX%.” only if ≥ threshold.

Me:
Can we show both charts at once?

AI:
Yes. Added:
- viz_both(res) → calls viz_temp(res) then viz_rain(res).
- Menu option “3) Both” triggers it.

Me:
I got a TypeError in the rain chart: “object of type 'int' has no len().”

AI:
That’s plt.vlines(x, 0, v, 2) — the 4th positional arg is colors, not linewidth.
Fix: plt.vlines(x, 0, v, linewidth=2) (keyword argument).

Me:
I also had a NameError for main_menu().

AI:
Removed the main_menu() call and kept everything inside run_app(). Called run_app() at the end.

Me:
Can provide a  short list of questions my professor can try.

AI:
Yes, Provided SAMPLE_QUESTIONS with a few diverse examples:
- “Will it rain today in Perth?” (rain)
- “Is it cold tomorrow in Melbourne?” (temperature)
- “Weather in Auckland in 4 days?” (general)
- “Is rain likely in 6000 tomorrow?” (PIN + rain)
- “Temperature in Adelaide in 3 days?” (offset + temperature)
